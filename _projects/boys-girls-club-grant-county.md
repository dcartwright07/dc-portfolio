The Boys & Girls Club of Grant County strives for excellence when serving the Grant County of Indiana community. They offer opportunities for adults to volunteer in their community and create spaces for the youth to positively engage others while learning various lessons through experiences. As a result, the club makes a positive impact on the community it serves. I partnered with the Boys & Girls Club to give them a platform in which to display what they are doing and provide a way for donors to sponsor their efforts.
