Taylor University is a small faith based institution that calls the small town of Upland, Indiana home. Among the achievement they have acquired, they have been ranked #1 Best Midwest College by the US News & World Report. The website was designed to have content most prospective students would find more important be readily available to them. The goal was to increase the engagement of Taylor’s prospective audience by providing the necessary information to help students in the decision making process for choosing a college. This project is ongoing because I currently work at Taylor University full-time as the University Marketing’s Senior Web Developer.
