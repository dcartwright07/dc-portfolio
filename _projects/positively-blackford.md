Positively Blackford is a news outlet for Blackford Initiative. The purpose of this project is to highlight the positive aspects of the Blackford County Community. Therefore, Kevin and I created a website so the Blackford Initiative team can draw attention, through stories, the positives affecting their community. The initial launch of the project creates the platform for a voice; however, our partnership helps enhance the tool they use to share their stories.
