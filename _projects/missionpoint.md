MissionPoint Community Church is location in Warsaw, Indiana. MissionPoint requested to have their old website updated and more modern. They desired their new to have be more visually engaging with those that visit the site. MissionPoint also need the information to be much easier to find and to be accessible both on desktop and on mobile devices. Through the many challenges, my partner and I were able to deliver a site that they were excited about that address immediate needs.
